## Docker Swarm example

## Startup
- Install a VM system, we use [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
- On Mac, install Docker toolbox. Here's the [docker docs](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/docker-toolbox/#the-docker-toolbox-environment).
They also use Virtualbox in there tutorial..

## Links

The main ideas are from this blog:
[https://botleg.com/stories/log-management-of-docker-swarm-with-elk-stack/](https://botleg.com/stories/log-management-of-docker-swarm-with-elk-stack/)
and the predecessor [https://botleg.com/stories/monitoring-docker-swarm-with-cadvisor-influxdb-and-grafana/](https://botleg.com/stories/monitoring-docker-swarm-with-cadvisor-influxdb-and-grafana/)
which sets up a Swarm cluster.
## Unfinished buisness

Basically everything..
- Check logging vs monitoring;
- Just copy pasted yet
- Think about ports, structuring of starting scripts.
- Play around with scaling
- Understand VM setup : https://docs.docker.com/machine/get-started/#start-local-machines-on-startup
